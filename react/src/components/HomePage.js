                <p>This application allows users to browse freely through all the papers that were presented at the 2021 Chiplay Conference.</p>
                <p>Under the menu dropdown, there are 6 different conference tracks that can be selected, all the papers being organized by track.</p>
                <p>Each paper has a title, an abstract, its authors, and it can be seen whether it had received an award or not.</p>
                <p>Each author has at least one country and institution, which represent his/her affiliation(s) to the selected paper.</p>
                <p>Under the Admin page, the administrator can log in with the secret credentials, and give or remove awards for all the papers.</p>
